# datastructures
This repository contains the assignments which I have completed for "Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals" Specialization on Coursera offered by University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. After completing this course, I have realised that HashMaps are super amazing and now, my favourite data structure :)

This repo only contains the offline assignments which I have completed. There were additional exercises which were completed on the online compiler. All projects were written on the Nano editor and built in the Ubuntu Linux Terminal environment. I used MinGW compiler. Now that I look back, using an IDE would've made much more sense. But hey, I learned to use the Terminal! >_

Below is the brief explanation of each folder and my contribution:

1. ImageT - The functions and declarations in files "ImageTransform.cpp" and "ImageTransform.h" were completed by me. Here, I had to develop three functions which will edit the input image pixel-by-pixel. 

2. LinkedList - In this directory, the codes in "LinkedListExercises.cpp" were completed by me. This exercise taught me to develop a templated LinkedList from scratch. Personally, Linked Lists are cool but I'd rather use dynamic arrays in many use cases :)

3. GenericTree - Here, I completed two exercises. One made me understand trees and it's structure, the other where I traversed a tree using BFS algorithm. Please refer the "GenericTreeExercises.cpp" file.

4. graph_search - This one was a pretty heavy exercise but I found the implementation fun to do. Here, there are three exercises(which also had sub-exercises) to complete, the description of which and the code I developed can be found in "GraphSearchExercises.cpp".

5. UnorderedMap - (My Favourite) Basically C++'s STL version of HashMaps. The exercises can be found in "UnorderedMapExercises.cpp". Here, I had to complete three exercises which had sub-exercises in them. The exercises dealt with constructing a wordcount function with hashmaps and uses of some of the unordered map's ADT in C++ like the .at(), .count() functions. The third part dealt with one dimensional Dynamic Programming and use of HashMaps for memoization. Pretty cool!

Thank You for reading!
