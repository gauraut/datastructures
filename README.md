# datastructures
This repository contains the assignments which I have completed for "Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals" Specialization on Coursera offered by University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. After completing this course, I have realised that HashMaps are super amazing and now, my favourite data structure :)

This repo only contains the offline assignments which I have completed. There were additional exercises which were completed on the online compiler. All projects were written on the Nano editor and built in the Ubuntu Linux Terminal environment. I used MinGW compiler. Now that I look back, using an IDE would've made much more sense. But hey, I learned to use the Terminal! >_

Below is the brief explanation of each folder and my contribution:

1. ImageT - The functions and declarations in files "ImageTransform.cpp" and "ImageTransform.h" were completed by me. Here, I had to develop three functions which will edit the input image pixel-by-pixel. 

2. LinkedList - In this directory, the codes in "LinkedListExercises.cpp" were completed by me. This exercise taught me to develop a templated LinkedList from scratch. Personally, Linked Lists are cool but I'd rather use dynamic arrays in many use cases :)

3. GenericTree - Here, I completed two exercises. One made me understand trees and it's structure, the other where I traversed a tree using BFS algorithm.

4.
