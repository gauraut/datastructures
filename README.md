# datastructures
This repository contains the assignments which I have completed for "Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals" Specialization on Coursera offered by University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. After completing this course, I have realised that HashMaps are super amazing and now, my favourite data structure :)

This repo only contains the offline assignments which I have completed. There were additional exercises which were completed on the online compiler.
